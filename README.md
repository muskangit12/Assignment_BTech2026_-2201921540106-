Problem 1: Using inheritance, one class can acquire the properties of others. Consider the following Animal class:
Platform Used : HackerRank
In C++, we can achieve similar functionality by using inheritance. We start with an "Animal" class that has only one method, "walk":

class Animal{ public: void walk(){ cout <<"I am walking"<<endl; } };

Next, we create a "Bird" class that inherits from the "Animal" class and adds a "fly" method. This is done using the "public" inheritance specifier:

class Bird : public Animal{ public: void fly(){ cout <<"I am flying"<<endl; } };

Now, a "Bird" object can both "walk" and "fly", since it inherits all the properties and behaviors of the "Animal" class.

Finally, we add a "sing" method to the "Bird" class and modify the "main" function to demonstrate the functionality:

#include using namespace std;

class Animal{ public: void walk(){ cout<<"I am walking"<<endl; } };

class Bird:public Animal{ public: void fly(){ cout<<"I am flying"<<endl; } void sing(){ cout <<"I am singing"<<endl; } };

int main(){ Bird bird; bird.walk(); bird.fly(); bird.sing(); return 0; }

The output of this C++ code will be:

I am walking I am flying I am singing

This demonstrates that the "Bird" class has all the properties of the "Animal" class and also has its unique methods.
