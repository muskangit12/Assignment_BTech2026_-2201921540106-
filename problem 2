problem 2
ruct is a way to combine multiple fields to represent a composite data structure, which further lays the foundation for Object Oriented Programming. For example, we can store details related to a student in a struct consisting of his age (int), first_name (string), last_name (string) and standard (int).

struct can be represented as

struct NewType {
    type1 value1;
    type2 value2;
    .
    .
    .
    typeN valueN;
};
You have to create a struct, named Student, representing the student's details, as mentioned above, and store the data of a student.

typedef struct Student Student;
struct Student {
    int age;
    int standard;
    string first_name;
    string last_name;
