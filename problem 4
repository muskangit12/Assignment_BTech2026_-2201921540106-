Problem 4
Write a C++ program to implement a class called Circle that has private member variables for radius. Include member functions to calculate the circle's area and circumference.
class Circle {
  private: 
    double radius;

  public:
    Circle(double rad): radius(rad) {}

    double calculateArea() {
      return PI * pow(radius, 2);
    }

    double calculateCircumference() {
      return 2 * PI * radius;
    }
};
